A failing “cat” can trigger a check engine light and / or produce an unpleasant exhaust odor, but converter failure is often caused by abnormal combustion and rough engine operation, sometimes accompanied by a blinking check engine light. Because of its precious metals content, converters are expensive to replace and often targeted by thieves. \n";
