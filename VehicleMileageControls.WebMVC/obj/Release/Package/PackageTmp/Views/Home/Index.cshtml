        <p class="lead">This app took so much blood, sweat, and tears. I'm proud of what I've accomplished but there is so much room for improvement. I can't wait to work on it more in the future!</p>

            <h2>The Idea</h2>
            <p>I randomly brainstormed this application when I was fixing my car in Chicago. My application will have three basic functions with a total of five datatables (six if you count an unused table I made).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-3">
            <h2>Function One</h2>
            <p>To give the user messages that remind them to check/change certain things in their car depending on the odomoter mileage integer entered.  If a message is triggered to populate at 5,000 miles then the same message should populate at 10,000, then 15,000 etc... This is for a user who knows practically nothing about auto-mechanics.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-3">
            <h2>Function Two</h2>
            <p>To provide the user information and images about all major (and many minor) aspects of the car. Let's say the user is somewhat competent (rare I know) when it comes to auto mechanics. This table will contain strings and images about each car part, where it's located, how to check/replace it, tools needed, if they should leave it to an expert, etc... It will also have lots and lots of properties. This is for a user who has an intermediate knowledge base of auto-mechanics.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-3">
            <h2>Function Three</h2>
            <p>To provide the user the ability to add short notes to their odometer mileage entries. What they thought was wrong with their car, what they experienced when they brought in the car to an auto-shop, how they/or the mechanic fixed the vehicle, etc... Literally anything! This can also be connected to past vehicle history entries so you can enter what has already been done to your vehicle.</p>
